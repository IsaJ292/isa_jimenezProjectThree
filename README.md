# Project Overview - Festival EcoMexico
### The main purpose of this website is to give some information regarding the event EcoMexico and just what it aims to accomplish! The festival is an enviormental and climate change event that is aimed at providing the general public with information regarding climate issues and land issues in Mexico. I wanted to talk about these issues in my project because it felt imporntant and was close to home for me. One design note that I decided to run with was keeping the logo of my festival somewhat hidden in my website. Scrolling through you can see it at the bottom of my main page but the more important logo was on my volunteer page. While extremely unconventional to standard navigation systems, I wanted the viewer to remeber the local organizations logo and story first then my own. In the end I hope we can all come together to help spread the message about climate change!
